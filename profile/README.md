# T-DSP

**Open modular audio platform for musicians, engineers, and developers.**

T-DSP combines studio-quality audio with the [Teensy](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/) microcontroller and the [Teensy Audio Library](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_Audio.html) in a flexible, hackable format. Build custom digital mixers, craft unique instruments, prototype audio products, or just experiment with DSP -- T-DSP gives you the tools to bring your ideas to life.

## Design Philosophy

- **Modular** -- Codec modules solder onto backplane PCBs like components. Design your own backplane with whatever jacks and connectors your application needs.
- **Open hardware** -- All designs are KiCad projects with schematics, PCB layouts, BOMs, and 3D models published here.
- **Standard interfaces** -- I2S audio, I2C control, 2.54mm headers. Works with Teensy, ESP32, or any compatible microcontroller.
